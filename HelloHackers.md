#  1. INTRO TO COMMANDS
# AIM
The main aim of this challenge is to introduce you to commands 

# MYFLAG
**FLAG** : 'pwn.college{clo7oOQ3xE7ivre45pGVEfVZXIE.QX3YjM1wCN0AzNzEzW}'

# Solution

this will give u the flag.


```bash
$ hello
pwn.college{clo7oOQ3xE7ivre45pGVEfVZXIE.QX3YjM1wCN0AzNzEzW}
```



#  2 . INTRO TO ARGUMENTS


# Aim
to find the flag by passing command along with argument

# MYFLAG
my **flag** : pwn.college{AXCZTf7zS3qoSycYutCLXXZMZiY.QX4YjM1wCN0AzNzEzW}

# Solution
type in hello hackers where hello is the command and hackers is a single argument.

# WHAT I LEARNT 
 When you type a line of text and hit enter, the shell actually parses your input into a command and its arguments.  first word is command and subsequent words are arguments



 ```bash
$ hello hackers
pwn.college{AXCZTf7zS3qoSycYutCLXXZMZiY.QX4YjM1wCN0AzNzEzW}
```
