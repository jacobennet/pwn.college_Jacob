# BACKGROUNDING PROCESSES

This module teaches you how to  background a process without suspending.
# FLAG

My flag ~ pwn.college{IjSfrEfu4WtSD450cVL7IwH-MHX.QX5QDO0wCN0AzNzEzW}

# SOLUTION 

append & to /challenge/run to run it in background without suspending it and obtain the flag


```

hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$ /challenge/run &
[1] 161
hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$


Yay, you started me in the background! Because of that, this text will probably
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt, but you're used to that by now...

Anyways! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{IjSfrEfu4WtSD450cVL7IwH-MHX.QX5QDO0wCN0AzNzEzW}

```


# WHAT I LEARNT

By appending & to command you can background a  process without suspending it.
