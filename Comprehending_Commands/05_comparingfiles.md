# WHAT I LEARNT

diff  compares two files line by line and shows you exactly what's different between them.
The output of above tells us that after line 3 in the first file  decoys_only.txt, the second file decoys_and_real.txt has an additional line (`3a4`Â means "after line 3 of file1, add line 4 of file2").
